Data Use Statement

The Cancer Genome Atlas Consortium is pleased to provide the research
community with preliminary data prior to publication. Users are
requested to carefully consider and abide by the following guidelines.

1. These data are preliminary and have yet to be validated as
polymorphisms and/or somatic mutations by methods orthologous to DNA
sequencing. Researchers are warned that the preliminary data have a
significant uncertainity and should be used with caution.

2. The Consortium welcomes the use of these data by the research
community for the investigation of individual genes. However, the
data are formally unpublished and users should follow standard scientific
etiquette and practices concerning unpublished data. With regard to the
publication of subsequent results, the Consortium makes two specific requests:
a) That investigators refrain from publishing a global analysis of
these data.
b) That all publications appropriately acknowledge TCGA Consortium for
providing preliminary data prior to publication.
