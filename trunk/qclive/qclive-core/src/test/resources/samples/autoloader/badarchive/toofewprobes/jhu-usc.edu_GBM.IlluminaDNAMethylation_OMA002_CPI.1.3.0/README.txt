README for TCGA archive jhu-usc.edu_GBM.IlluminaDNAMethylation_OMA002_CPI.1.3.0

The data archive contains The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis of DNA methylation profilings using the Illumina Golden Gate Methylation Bead Array platform. DNA samples were received, bisulfite converted and the methylation profiling was evaluated using Illumina DNA Methylation Golden Gate technology.

This archive contains data on one DNA methylation bead array for 43 GBM tumor samples (batches 1 and 2).

The AVG_beta value represents the final methylation value for each locus, while the Cy3 and Cy5 measurements represent methylated and unmethylated DNA signal intensities for each hybridization. The Detection p-values (Detection PVAL)provide an indication of DNA methylation measurement quality for each locus.
