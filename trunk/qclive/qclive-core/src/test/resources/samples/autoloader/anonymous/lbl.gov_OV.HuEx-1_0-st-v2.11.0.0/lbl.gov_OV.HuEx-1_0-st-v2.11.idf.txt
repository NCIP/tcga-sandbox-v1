Protocol Description	Transfer RNA for labeling	Transfer RNA for labeling	"Standard Affymetrix labeling protocol as of January 2007 for the HuEx1.0 arrays. Briefly, selection of Ribominus RNA, followed by random hexamer mediated reverse transcription and in vitro transcription of biotinylated labeled extract. Arrays are hybridized, washed, and scanned using the standard methods"	"Standard Affymetrix hybridization protocol as of January 2007 for the HuEx1.0 arrays.

First, the collection of cel files is pre-processed using RMA. Then FIRMA method is applied to robustly assess alternative splicing status of exons. Probesets are then filtered to reduce common sources of false positives: low expressing exons and genes, exons and genes with low standard deviation, exons with extremely low standard deviation compared to the rest of the gene, exons with few probes, and genes with few exons. Also removed are exons containing SNPs with large average heterozygosity and exons with probes that do not complement a unique genomic region."
