
This data archive contains the RNA expression data for cancer samples
of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The experiments were
performed by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard using the
Affymetrix HT_HG-U133A microarray platform.

Please see DESCRIPTION.txt for algorithm description of the data protocols.

For simple organization and easy tracking of samples, we group all
samples of each batch of TCGA Plates in one archive.  Batches are
numbered by the order they were processed and that order corresponds
to the archive serial index.  Here is the current grouping:

Batch	TCGA_Plates	Archive
1	177	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.1.*
2	202	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.2.*
3	219	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.3.*
4	233	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.4.*
5	280	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.5.*
6	298	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.6.*
7	306	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.7.*
8	338,342	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.8.*
9	362	broad.mit.edu_OV.HT_HG-U133A.9.*
10	389	broad.mit.edu_GBM.HT_HG-U133A.10.*
11	404	broad.mit.edu_OV.HT_HG-U133A.11.*
12	434	broad.mit.edu_OV.HT_HG-U133A.12.*


Each revision archive has the latest data for samples belonging to its
corresponding batch of TCGA Plates.

The higher-level analysis data, that potentially include samples from multiple
batches, are included in the latest revision of the archive with the
highest serial index.
