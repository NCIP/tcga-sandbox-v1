Effective <GO_LIVE_DATE>, clinical, biospecimen and auxiliary XML files and their corresponding biotabs will be transitioning from Restricted to Open-Access.
During this transition, content in the Controlled-Access HTTP Directory will be current as of <GO_LIVE_DATE> and will remain there for 30 days, allowing a grace period for the redirection of automated procedures. During this time, archives in the Restricted area will not be updated.
For the latest data, please access files from the Open-Access directory.

To reiterate, scripts and users that access BCR XML files or biotabs from:
Controlled-Access HTTP Directory https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/tcga4yeo/tumor/
should redirect their queries to:
Open-Access HTTP Directory https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcgafiles/ftp_auth/distro_ftpusers/anonymous/tumor/
