    # ====================
    
        # Number of events to pre-allocate (e.g. 256 * 1024 = 262144)
        #
        # Non-server applications may want to set this to a lower number.

        # Minimum number of processor cores that should be available on the host
        # system.
        #
        # This number will be multiplied by the 
        # 'eventBus.threadPool.minProcessors.scaleFactor' property and the 
        # resulting product will be used to initialize a fixed thread pool for 
        # processing events.
        #
        # If the available processor cores is less than the provided value,
        # a cached thread pool will be used by default.
        eventBus.threadPool.minProcessors               2
        
        # The scale factor used to increase the ratio of threads per processing
        # core.
        #
        # If the 'minProcessors' requirement is not met, this property is
        # ignored.
