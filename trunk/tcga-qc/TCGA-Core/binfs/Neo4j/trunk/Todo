TODO list for Perl module REST::Neo4p

- Create convenience index objects for auto indexes
- parse service errors and pass up to user with better context

- use :content_file in Agent to bring large queries down to disk
- modify the fetchrow_array iterator to stream the json from the content on disk
- then can't use the response content accessor directly
