jhu-usc.edu.HumanMethylation27.[revision].lvl-2=(DESCRIPTION.txt) Level 2 data files contain the beta value calculations for each probe and sample, calculated as: Beta = M/(M+U), using non-background corrected data. In this formula, M and U represent the mean signal intensities for replicate methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) probes on the array. Data points with a detection p-value > 0.05 are masked as "NA", and represent beta values with non-significant detection of DNA methylation compared to background. Please note that we use a slightly different formula for calculating the beta value than Illumina BeadStudio or GenomeStudio software.

Probes annotated as having a SNP within 10bp of the interrogated site are masked as NA across all samples, and probes with a non-detection probability (P-value) greater than 0.05 in a given sample are masked as NA on that chip.

The clusters, confidences and calls files were generated.  The Birdseed was run again this time using the --clusters option and using the SNP probe sets from all samples with the clusters file from the previous normals run.
