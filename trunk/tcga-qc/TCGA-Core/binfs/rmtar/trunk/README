README for rmtar.sh

This bash script effectively removes a given list of archive files
from a DCC tar-gzip archive. Given the archive and the files, rmtar
generates a replacement archive with the given files removed and a new
manifest that logs only the files that remain. A new archive md5 file
is also created.

The replacement archive has the SAME NAME as the original archive.
The replacement archive will appear in the directory in which rmtar
runs. If rmtar is run in the directory where the original archive
exists, the orignal archive will be renamed <archivefilename>e
(appended 'e', like sed -i does), as a backup.

Usage is:
$ ./rmtar.sh this_is_my_archive.tar.gz remove_me_1.ext remove_me_2.ext ...

Do not give the full path of the file within the archive, only the
filename.  This works as long as the DCC archive conventions are met.
