# This README assumes you have all telemetry files in the current directory, 
# as well as the BAM file / exchange area file named exchange.tab, 
# (as well as tcga_subj.txt which lists patients by disease)

# First, unzip all .tar.gz files
for i in *.tar.gz; do tar -xzf $i; done

# Then, delete all old .txt files from last report (or move them somewhere else)
rm *.txt

# Then create blank initial file:
touch sra_samples.txt

# Then get raw data from all dirs:
for i in NCBI_SRA_Metadata_TCGA_*; do grep -P "\tTCGA-" $i/SRA_Accessions* | cut -f5,6,10 | sort -u >> sra_samples.txt; done

# Then sort:
sort -u sra_samples.txt > sra_samples_sorted.txt

# Then clean:
perl parse.pl sra_samples_sorted.txt

# Then add BAM file info (need to copy exchange.tab to this dir, get in email from SRA)
perl parseBAM.pl exchange.tab sra_samples_sorted.txt.clean.txt

# Then run script to add disease name to the file for all samples
perl addDiseaseColumn.pl sra_samples_sorted.txt.clean.txt tcga_subj.txt

# finally, open sra_samples_sorted.txt.clean.txt in Excel, bold the headers, and sort by the first date column
