repgen.pl - Parse a number of line-record text dumps into a
tab-delimited report

repgen.pl is a pretty flexible parser/reducer. You create
configuration modules as exemplified by RepGen/telem.pm to accept
different kinds of text input files and to output a reduction of data
into a tab-delimited text file with a desired header line, suitable
for importing into Excel, for example. The main restriction is that
the input files must contain one record of interest per line of text.

RECOMMENDED: add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:

 export PERL5LIB=$HOME/lib/perl5

and create this directory:

 $ mkdir -p ~/lib/perl5

To install into your local home directory, issue the following commands in the
distribution directory (skip the test action at your own risk!):

perl Build.PL --install_base=~
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

After installation as above, you can get full documentation by issuing

 $ perldoc repgen.pl

For usage info, issue

 $ repgen.pl --help
