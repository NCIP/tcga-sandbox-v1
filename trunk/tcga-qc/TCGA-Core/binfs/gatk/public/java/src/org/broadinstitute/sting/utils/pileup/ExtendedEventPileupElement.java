/**
 * In the "standard" locus traversal mode,
 * the traversal is performed striclty over the reference bases. Thus, only pileups of bases (and hence local events
 * such as point mutations) are "seen" at every invocation of the walker's map() function at every (genomic) locus. Deletions
 * are seen on the base-by-base basis (i.e. the pileup does keep the information about the current reference base being deleted
 * in some reads), but the information about the extended event (deletion length, string of all deleted bases) is not kept.
 * The insertions that may be present in some reads are not seen at all in such strict reference traversal mode.
 *
 * By convention, any extended event (indel) is mapped onto the reference at the last base prior to the event (i.e.
 * last base before the insertion or deletion). If the special "extended" traversal mode is turned on and there is
 * an indel in at least one read that maps onto the reference position Z, the walker's map function will be called twice:
 * first call will be performed in a "standard" mode, with a pileup of bases over the position Z, and then the additional
 * call will be made at the same position with a pileup of event/noevent calls, where events are extended and contain
 * full information about insertions/deletions. Then the next, "standard", call to map() will be performed at the next
 * (covered) reference position. Note that if the extended event at Z was a deletion, the "standard" base pileup at
 * Z+1 and following bases may still contain deleted bases. However the fully extended event call will be performed
 * only once, at the position where the indel maps (starts).
 *
 * This class wraps an "extended" event (indel) so that in can be added to a pileup of events at a given location.
