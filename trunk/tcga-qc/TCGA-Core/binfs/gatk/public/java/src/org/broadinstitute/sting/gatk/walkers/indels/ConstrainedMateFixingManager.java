/**
 * A locally resorting, mate fixing sam file writer that supports an idiom where reads are only moved around if
 * the ISIZE of the pair is < X and reads are not allowed to move any more than Y bp from their original positions.
 *
 * To understand this data structure, let's begin by asking -- when are we certain we know the position of read R added
 * to the writer and its mate M given that R has been added to the writer (but M may not be), their ISIZE in R, at the
 * moment that a read K is added to the writer, under the constraints X and Y?  Complex I know.  First, because
 * reads cannot move more than Y bp in either direction, we know that R originated at most R.pos + Y bp from its
 * current position.  Also, we know that K is at most K.pos + Y bp from it's original position.  If R is maximally
 * shifted to the right, and K shifted to the left, then they could at most move 2Y together.  So if the distance
 * between R and K > 2Y, we know that there are no reads left in the original stream that could be moved before R.
 *
 * Now, we also need to be certain if we have a mate pair M, that won't emit R before we can incorporate any move of
 * M into the mate pair info R.  There are two cases to consider here:
 *
 * If ISIZE > X, we know that we won't move M when we see it, so we can safely emit R knowing that
 * M is fixed in place.
 *
 * If ISIZE <= X, M might be moved, and it we have to wait until we see M in the stream to know it's position.
 * So R must be buffered until either M arrives, or we see a read K that's more than 2Y units past the original position
 * of M.
 *
 * So the worst-case memory consumption here is proportional to the number of reads
 * occurring between R and M + 2 Y, and so is proportional to the depth of the data and X and Y.
 *
 * This leads to the following simple algorithm:
 *
 * addAlignment(newRead):
 *   addReadToListOfReads(newRead)
 *   update mate pair of newRead if present in list of reads
 *
 *   for ( read in list of reads [in order of increasing read.pos] ):
 *     if read.pos < newRead.pos - 2Y && (read.isize >= X || read.matePos < newRead.pos - 2 * Y):
 *        emit read and remove from list of reads
 *     else:
 *        break
