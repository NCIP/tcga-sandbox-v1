/**
 * This is a low-level iterator designed to provide system-wide generic support for reading record-oriented data
 * files. The only assumption made is that every line in the file provides a complete and separate data record. The records
 * can be associated with coordinates or coordinate intervals, there can be one or more records associated with a given
 * position/interval, or intervals can overlap. The records must be comprised of delimited fields, but the format is
 * otherwise free. For any specific line-based data format, an appropriate implementation of ReferenceOrderedDatum must be
 * provided that is capable of parsing itself from a single line of data. This implementation will be used,
 * through reflection mechanism, as a callback to do all the work.
 *
 * The model is, hence, as follows:
 *
 *  String dataRecord <---> RodImplementation ( ::parseLine(dataRecord.split(delimiter)) is aware of the format and fills
 *                                              an instance of RodImplementation with data values from dataRecord line).
 *
 *
 *  instantiation of RODRecordIterator(dataFile, trackName, RodImplementation.class) will immediately provide an iterator
 * that walks along the dataFile line by line, and on each call to next() returns a new RodImplementation object
 * representing a single line (record) of data. The returned object will be initialized with "track name" trackName -
 * track names (as returned by ROD.getName()) are often used in other parts of the code to distinguish between
 * multiple streams of (possibly heterogeneous) annotation data bound to an application.
 *
 * This generic iterator skips and ignores a) empty lines, b) lines starting with '#' (comments): they are never sent back
 * to the ROD implementation class for processing.
 *
 * This iterator does not actually check if the ROD records (lines) in the file are indeed ordedered by coordinate,
 * and it does not depend on such an order as it still implements a low-level line-based traversal of the data. Higher-level
 * iterators/wrappers will perform all the necessary checks.
 *
 * Note: some data formats/ROD implementations may require a header line in the file. In this case the current (ugly)
 * mechanism is as follows:
 * 1) rod implementation's ::initialize(file) method should be able to open the file, find and read the header line
 *    and return the header object (to be kept by the iterator)
 * 2) rod implementation's ::parseLine(header,line) method should be capable of making use of that saved header object now served to it
 * and
 * 3) ::parseLine(header,line) should be able to recognize the original header line in the file and skip it (after ROD's initialize()
 *    method is called, the iterator will re-open the file and start reading it from the very beginning; there is no
 *    other way, except for "smart" ::parseLine(), to avoid reading in the header line as "data").
