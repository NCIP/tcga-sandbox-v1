				<div class="stdTitle" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Welcome to the TCGA DCC Prototypes page</div>
				
				<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The following pages are available for exploration.</div>
				<ul class="triangle">
					<li>
						<span class="demoTitle1"><a href="misc/tcgaBunsen.htm#interactivePatient">Bunsen</a> - Prototype for an interactive selector of clinical data</span><br/>

						This is a proposal only so far, which is why it has a totally unofficial name. ;-)  Bunsen pulls in a whole set of clinical
						parameters to the front end and lets the user play with the parameters while the number of patients within the selected 
						values is continually adjusted.  The adjustment takes place both for the number of patients in the selected parameter and
						from the interaction with all of the parameters.  Hmm, I explained that poorly.  Just play with it and you'll see what I mean. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="demoTitle1">Watson - Prototype for the new version of the Data Browser</span><br/>

						This is only partially complete.  Pick a disease and click on "Define Patient Classes". No results yet and just showing
						patient classes.  The button for go on the 2nd page does not yet work.  More updates as I go along.
						<ul>
							<li><a href="misc/tcgaWatsonDemo.htm">Variation A</a>
							<li><a href="misc/tcgaWatson.htm">Variation B</a>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<!--li>
						<a href="misc/overDash.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">Overview Dashboard</span></a><br/>
						A prototype for the Grand OverDash.  Click on the nodes in the map in the upper right to
						dash from dash to dash...
					</li-->
					<!--li>
						<a href="portal3/tcgaHome2.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">Data Portal Refresh</span></a><br/>
						The new look for the TCGA DCC data portal.
					</li-->
					<!--li>
						<a href="misc/graph6raph.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">Pipeline Report - aka The Big Dashboard</span></a><br/>
						A demonstration of a Sankey diagram driven from a json file which
						describes the nodes to be displayed and contains the data.
					</li-->
					<li>
						<span class="demoTitle1">Directory Access Interface</span><br/>
						Two potential version of a javascript intermediated directory access interface
						to the TCGA data.  Note: Only the GBM directory tree, and the first directory
						of each of it's child directories, is populated.  In both cases, this is a very
						limited implementation.  There are lots of behavioral tweaks I would add in
						putting this out for public consumption.
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="misc/dai1.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">DAI Version 1</span></a><br/>
								A version with a single tree window where you just walk down the directory
								tree in that window.  Double cliking on a directory in the panel will open
								the directory, or you can use the +/- toggles.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="misc/dai2.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">DAI Version 2</span></a><br/>
								A version with two windows, one allows you to walk down the directory tree.
								The other window just shows the files in a single directory.  The synchronize
								button, when pressed, will synchronize the two windows.  Double cliking on a
								directory in either panel will open the directory.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<!--li>
						<span class="demoTitle1">Graphing Libraries Demos</span><br/>
						These will be growing.  g.Raphael is up next and is already in work.
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="misc/graphProtovisDemo.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">Protovis Demo</span></a> - <img style="position:relative;top: 3px;" src="firefox-16.png"> FireFox only for now<br/>
								<a target="newWin" href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis Library</a> <img src="portal3/images/newWin.gif"><br/>
								A demonstration of putting Protovis graphs in an ExtJS context.  Also just an
								exploration of the Protovis javascript graphing library.  The major problem I've
								found, it's not very happy in IE, and for Chrome/Safari, the code has to be inlined
								in the div.  Very odd.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="misc/graphTufteDemo.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">TufteGraph Demo</span></a><br/>
								<a target="newWin" href="http://xaviershay.github.com/tufte-graph/">TufteGraph Library</a> <img src="portal3/images/newWin.gif"><br/>
								A demonstration of putting TufteGraph graphs in an ExtJS context.  This one doesn't do
								much, just bar graphs and stacked bar graphs, but it makes them very simple and works in
								multiple browsers.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li-->
					<!--li>
						<a href="misc/uuidProto.htm"><span class="demoTitle1">UUID Browser Prototype</span></a><br/>
						To start, click on the nice big search button.  If you want to go directly to the uuid explorer,
						as if you had typed in a single UUID, type a 1 into the UUID field and then hit the search button.
					</li-->
