#sample Summary report messages
sampleSummary.desc.summary=Provides a count summary of Sample IDs by Disease Study, Center, Analyte Type, and Platform.
sampleSummary.desc=<p>The Experiment Sample-Counts Summary Report provides a count summary of Sample IDs by Disease Study, Center, Analyte Type, and Platform. Sample counts are provided for Sample IDs a BCR Reported Sending to a Center, Sample IDs the DCC Received from a Center, unaccounted for BCR Sample IDs that a Center Reported, unaccounted for Center Sample IDs that a BCR Reported, and sample ID counts by data level. Links are provided for each positive count that resolve to list of Sample IDs for a specific count. This report is useful for determining how many and which Samples are in the TCGA pipeline. The counts are based on <i>reported</i> IDs either form a BCR or from a GSC/CGCC.</p>
#disclaimer
sampleSummary.disclaimer=Disclaimer: The above table(s) reflect as accurately as possible the sample IDs and ID annotations submitted to the DCC to date. At the present time, the intended platform for a given aliquot can only be inferred from the disease and the identity of the GSC/CGCC that is encoded in the aliquot ID. If a given GSC/CGCC is using only one platform for a given disease, then this inference will be accurate. If the GSC/CGCC is using more than one platform for a disease, the DCC cannot accurately report ID counts per platform per disease. Of course, once a GSC/CGCC submits molecular data for an aliquot to the DCC, then the platform is known. In Phase 2 of the TCGA project there will be a standard operating procedure for a GSC/CGCC to report the intended platform for a given aliquot before submitting the molecular data.
#note
sampleSummary.note=A value of "Undetermined" for Platform indicates that the DCC has not received data for the indicated sample-analytes<br/><span style="color: red;">* = Although not in the latest current archive, level 4 data has been submitted</span>
#aliquot report messages
aliquotReport.desc.summary=Provides a summary of experiment Aliquot IDs by Disease Study, BCR Batch number, Receiving Center, Platform, and data levels (1-3).
aliquotReport.desc=<p>The Experiment Aliquot Report provides a summary of experiment Aliquot IDs by Disease Study, BCR Batch number, Receiving Center, Platform, and data levels (1-3). Aliquots are either described as <b>Submitted</b> or <b>Not Submitted</b> for each data level. A value of <b>Not Submitted</b> means that the DCC has not received data for an Aliquot ID for a particular data level. A value of <b>Submitted</b> means that the DCC has received data for an Aliquot ID for a particular data level. A <b>Submitted</b> value links to a list of files that represent the submitted data level for an aliquot ID. A filename may be clicked to download a file. This report is useful for determining which Aliquot IDs have outstanding data or locating the data for a specific Aliquot ID.</p>
#latest archive report messages
latestArchiveReport.desc.summary=Identifies the most recent version of all data in the Data Portal archives.
latestArchiveReport.desc=<p>The Latest Archive Report provides a list of archives that are the latest revision, the date the archive was added, and the archive type. If the submission is characterization-based (CGCC), then the associated sample-to-data relationship file (SDRF) is listed. If the submission is genomic sequencing-based, then the associated mutation (MAF) file is listed if the archive contains a MAF file. Archive Type reflects the aggregation of the data within the archive. A classic archive type can contain all levels and types of data, while all other types contain the specified type of data.</p> <p style=\\'padding-top:5px;\\'>Clicking on the blue text for Archive, Associated SDRF File, or Associated MAF file downloads the archive or file. The report can be filtered by clicking on the Toggle Filters button and selecting the archive type, or date range. Clicking on a column header sorts the results by that column. The report may be exported for other uses or a URL is provided to recreate the report filter. This report may be useful to those trying to mirror TCGA data. For example, a user could filter the report by date range to see what new data is available since the last download.</p>
#latest code table report messages
codeTablesReport.desc.summary=Lookup tables that identify the meaning of all codes and abbreviations used in the Data Portal.
codeTablesReport.desc=<p>The Code Tables Report provides a set of tables associating metadata in English with standard short codes and abbreviations for that data. The tables are organized by metadata type, e.g, the <b>Center</b> table is a list of TCGA participating centers and their abbreviations, while the <b>Tissue Source Site</b> table contains codes which map to kind of tissue, originating sample site, study abbreviation, and study name. Note that the tables themselves sometimes use codes or abbreviations in certain data columns; these codes can be translated using other code tables in this report.</p> <p style=\\'padding-top:5px;\\'>Browse the tables by using the scrollbar on the right of the panel, or by clicking the links on the left. Entire tables can be downloaded by clicking the <b>Export Data</b> pulldown at the top left of each table. Select the desired export format, and the download will begin automatically.</p>
#aliquotIdBreakdown report
aliquotIdBreakdownReport.desc.summary=Maps IDs for each step in the chain of provenance for each aliquot.
aliquotIdBreakdownReport.desc=<p>The Aliquot ID Breakdown Report maps IDs for each step in the chain of provenance for each aliquot. Each row contains an Aliquot ID, mapped to its associated Analyte ID (from which the aliquot was made), Sample ID (from which the analyte was produced), Patient ID (from whom the sample was taken).</p> <p style=\\'padding-top:5px;\\'>The user can filter the table to a desired set of values; for example, to obtain all aliquot IDs for a particular analyte, click <b>Show Filters</b>, enter the Analyte ID in the corresponding text box, and click <b>Filter Now</b>. The resulting table can be exported to the user\\'s machine by clicking <b>Export Data</b>, and selecting the desired format. More restrictive filters can be applied by entering further matching constraints in the <b>Filters Extended</b> pulldown.</p>
#bcrpipeline report
BCRPipelineReport.desc.summary=The BCR Pipeline Report provides graphical representations of the current state of the TCGA workflow.
BCRPipelineReport.desc=The BCR Pipeline Report provides graphical representations of the current state of the TCGA workflow. Total numbers of cases and tissue samples are summarized for each tumor type. Sample numbers at different stages of preparation and analysis are also presented.
#statsDashboard
statsDashboard.desc.summary=High-level statistics describing TCGA data content and use.
statsDashboard.desc=High-level statistics describing TCGA data content and use. These are graphical profiles of current TCGA data, including information about the size, content, and access of TCGA data, broken out by disease, platform, batch number and other factors.
# Link to BAM Telemetry reports
bamSummary.desc.summary=Identifies TCGA sequence data that is available from the dbGap database.
#project Case dashboard
projectCaseDashboard.desc.summary=The Project-Case Overview Dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of TCGA project progress.
projectCaseDashboard.desc=The Project-Case Overview Dashboard provides a high-level snapshot of TCGA project progress. Completion of sample analysis through multiple phases (acquisition, characterization, sequencing) is displayed as percent of program targets.

#bam telemetry report messages
bamTelemetryReport.desc.summary=The BAM Telemetry Report summarizes the TCGA-related sequence data available at CGHub.
bamTelemetryReport.desc=The BAM Telemetry Report summarizes the TCGA-related sequence data available at CGHub. Total number of cases sequenced for different cancer types, molecules, and centers are tabulated for all sequence data files.
#pending UUID report messages
shipped-items-pending-bcr-data-submission.desc.summary=A table of biospecimens shipped by the BCRs to GCCs and GSCs that have yet to arrive at the DCC as clinical and biospecimen data.
shipped-items-pending-bcr-data-submission.desc=Biospecimens are shipped by the BCRs to GCC and GSC Data Submission Centers for analysis. Before any Data Submission Center can submit analysis data to the DCC, the BCRs must first officially register the shipped biospecimen with the DCC by submitting clinical and biospecimen data. As there may be delays in gathering this data, this report informs the DCC and TCGA Network of the available shipped biospecimens to facilitate coordination.
